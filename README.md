# transcriptrack

This repo contains TranscripTrack, a WPF desktop application [my wife](https://github.com/jane0830) and I co-developed during 2020 which is no longer in active development. I am a former medical transcriptionist, and this application was our attempt to create an easy way for an MT to track productivity by storing data about lines of work done, divided out by line rate (in cents per line), client and work type (QA vs transcription, for example).
